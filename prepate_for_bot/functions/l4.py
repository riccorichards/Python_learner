'''
1: Implement a Basic Calculator: Create a function that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The function should take three parameters: two numbers and an operator, and handle division by zero gracefully.
2: Recursive Fibonacci Sequence: Write a function that computes the Fibonacci sequence using recursion and includes a mechanism to cache results for efficiency (memoization).
3: Binary Search Algorithm: Develop a function that implements the binary search algorithm to find an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of the item, or -1 if the item is not found.
4: Check Balanced Parentheses: Write a function that checks if the parentheses ((), {}, []) in a given string are balanced.
5: Longest Consecutive Sequence: Create a function that finds the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted list of integers.
6: String Permutations: Develop a function that returns all permutations of a given string.
7: Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache: Implement an LRU cache class that supports 'put' and 'get' operations efficiently.
8: Deep Copy of a Complex Data Structure: Write a function that performs a deep copy of a complex data structure (like a list that contains other lists or dictionaries).
9: Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm: Create a function that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer n.
10: Regular Expression Matcher: Develop a function that simulates a simple regular expression matcher supporting "." and "" characters, where "." matches any single character and "" matches zero or more of the preceding element.
